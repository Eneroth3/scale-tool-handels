This extension provides a simplified interface to handle Scale Tool handles on groups and components (pun intended). Instead of micro managing each of the 7 handle pairs individually this plugin automatically adjusts the diagonal handles depending on what main axes scaling is enabled in.

This can be useful on very slim components, e.g. pipes, where otherwise the correct handle is difficult to grab.

Please note that the handles in Scale Tool aren't instantly updated. If the tool is already active you can re-activate it to update the handles.


Testing Procedure:
This plugin introduces a simplified interface for setting scale handles which is normally controlled from the Dynamic Components plugin (although the feature itself is a part of the SketchUp core). Please check whether it's okay to expose this to Make users. Otherwise I can limit the Extension to only load in Pro as I did with my Solid Tools.
