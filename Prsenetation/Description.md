Handles Scale Tool handles (pun intended) on groups and components.
Useful to lock the scaling of a pipe to be only axial and to easier grab the correct handle.

Activated from **Extensions > Eneroth Scale Tool Handles**.
Personally I've set up Ctrl+Up, Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right as shortcuts for blue, green and red scaling handles,
and Ctrl+Down for 3D diagonal scaling handles.
